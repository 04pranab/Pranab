## 🌱 Overview

This repository is a **personal systems portfolio** and a living record of my ongoing exploration in  
**computer architecture and operating systems**.

My work here focuses on **learning through construction**: reading specifications, implementing small systems, and documenting observations along the way. The projects are intentionally scoped to remain clear, inspectable, and concept-driven rather than feature-complete.

## 🧭 Areas of Interest

- 🧠 Computer Architecture and ISA design
- 📘 RISC-V ecosystem and specifications
- ⚙️ Operating system fundamentals
- 🔩 Kernel and low-level system components
- 🔗 Hardware–software interaction
- 📊 Performance and design trade-offs

---

## 🔬 Current Focus

- 📖 Studying the **RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture** and its formal specifications
- 🧩 Implementing a **minimal operating system** to examine core OS abstractions
- 🔍 Developing a **research-oriented approach** alongside practical system building
- 🌐 Exploring the design of a **kernel-level network ingress subsystem** *(ongoing)*

---

## 🛠️ Languages & Tools

### Languages
- **C / C++**
- **Assembly** *(RISC-V focused; learning and experimentation)*
